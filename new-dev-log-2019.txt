spent 1:30 figuring out that I never selected EC2 as the trusted source when originally creating my role and frigged around with users, groups and other things including installing the aws cli. I now know a little more about access and IAM roles, groups and users. 

Now finding out I have a to have a codedeploy role and a ec2 role. OKay!

Deployments are failing due to: The overall deployment failed because 
1. too many individual instances failed deployment, 
2. too few healthy instances are available for deployment,
or 3. some instances in your deployment group are experiencing problems.

Makes me think that this is because I don't have a load balancer. I want to create a load balancer but have to set up a certificate for that to happen. ACM manager time.
